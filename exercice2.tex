%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{abstract}
This article gives an overview introduction to Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM), i.e., probabilistic methods to generate a 2D or 3D map of unknown areas under imperfect localization. The article provides a survey of the theoretical basis of SLAM as well as the core background information about the underlying techniques for implementing actual SLAM systems
